Job 5: hard-filter snps & indels on multiple expressions using VariantFiltration on aligned_reads/DAMICO_raw_snps_indels_tmp_combined.g.vcf.gz

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 1 of /mnt/linuxRDB/FamilyDAMICO_pipelineVC_GATK4/VariantFiltration/rules/gatk_VariantFiltration.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
aligned_reads/DAMICO_raw_snps_indels_hard_filter.vcf.gz.idx
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job VariantFiltration since they might be corrupted:
aligned_reads/DAMICO_raw_snps_indels_hard_filter.vcf.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
