Job 3: Calculate VQSLOD tranches for indels  and snpusing VariantRecalibrator on aligned_reads/DAMICO_raw_snps_indels_sitesonly.vcf.gz

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 1 of /mnt/linuxRDB/FamilyDAMICO_pipelineVC_GATK4/VariantFiltration/rules/gatk_VariantRecalibrator10000.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:

This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
